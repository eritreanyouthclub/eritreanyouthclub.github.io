<h2>Our group</h2>


The Eritrean Youth Club (ERC) is a registered community interest company, founded in Islington in 1995. Since this time, we have supported over 1,000 youth to build their connection with the local community, grow confidence and develop new skills. We currently have 100 members of our youth club.


<h2 style="margin-top:65px;">Our mission</h2>


Today, the Youth Club provides a range of programmes designed to allow young people to explore new activities and grow their community network, to allow them to reach their full potential.

Our key mission is to provide a service of happiness, experience and development.

Activities we offer include performing arts, multi sports, youth forums and journalism and awareness workshops.

<h2 style="margin-top:60px;">How we work?</h2>

We welcome all youth, aged from 8 – 19. While our core membership base began as a group of Eritrean youth, we now welcome all young people, regardless of heritage or background.

We host regular weekly sessions for our youth members, including:

* Journalism classes – every Tuesday
* Football and cultural group – every Thursday
* Cricket, basketball and football – every Saturday

These regular sessions are <b>free of charge</b>, and are run by community volunteers and sessional workers.

Once a month, a group of our youth attend the Young People’s Forum at City Hall.

We also offer a number of one-off events and trips, to allow our young people to try new activities. These events range from ice skating, to parent and child tennis, to cultural performances.
