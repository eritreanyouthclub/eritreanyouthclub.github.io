<h2 style="margin-top:75px;">One-off events</h2>


We aim to offer a range of one-off events, which support our youth in accessing new opportunities and building skills. These include:


Unique sporting activities at a range of London venues â€“ this can increase fitness and wellbeing, and grow confidence within our youth.
*	Kayak
*	Fencing
*	Ice skating
*	Tennis
*	Forest rock climbing
*	Diverse water sports


A range of fun activities to upskill our young people, and expose them to new community groups.
*	Pizza cooking class
*	Attending X-Factor auditions at Wembley Arena
*	T-shirt painting workshops


We also support our early talents, both by identifying and connecting young people with other organisations to foster their skills, and by providing a support base. For example, we recently connected a promising young runner with an Islington running club, leading to her participation in the junior London marathon.
