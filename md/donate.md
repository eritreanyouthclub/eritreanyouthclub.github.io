<h2 style=""> Funding support </h2>
In addition to our partners and volunteers, we also require financial support to carry out our regular and one-off activities. Costs can include venue hire, transportation, activity fees and sessional workers.
Past funders include the Cripplegate Foundation, Sport Islington, Small Magic Grant, Mother Tongue Supplementary Support and Great Get Together.
We are incredibly grateful for their support – the financial assistance that these organisations provide has allowed us to serve more than 1,000 young people over the past twenty years.
